### What I learned

I have recently started learning web development and just completed intermediate html and css. This was my first practice question on Frontend Mentor. I used the best my knowledge and skill to create the page. There was a lot to learn through this project. It helped me better my css skills and I get aware of more css properties related to tables. I also tried to add a responsive section which also required a bit of research.

```css
.instruction-box li::marker {
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-weight: 700;
}

@media (max-width: 500px) {
    body {
        margin: 2rem;
    }
}
```
